 ## How can you run the test case?

 **Step 1: Source code**

 ## Pattern used
 I am using those patterns to abstract behaviour.
 
 ### Page Object Pattern
 This pattern is commonly used on test automation to split the functionality of the page with the test case steps. I used when I did the class _Google_ where there put all functionality regarding thing to do on this page site.
 
 ### Factory Pattern 
 Also, I use this pattern, to create a different instance depending on the browser. I used the class _BrowserFactory_ where IÂ´ll generate the different instance according to the browser sent by the parameter.
