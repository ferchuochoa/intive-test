0.19.0 (2017-09-16)

Note that with geckodriver v0.19.0 the following versions are recommended:

Firefox 55.0 (and greater)
Selenium 3.5 (and greater)

Added
	- Added endpoint:
		- POST /session/{session id}/window/minimize for the Minimize Window command

	- Added preference extensions.shield-recipe-client.api_url to disable shield studies which could unexpectedly change the behavior of Firefox

	- Introduced the temporary, boolean capability moz:webdriverClick to enable the WebDriver conforming behavior of the Element Click command.

	- Added crashreporter environment variables to better control the browser in case of crashes

	- Added preference dom.file.createInChild set to true to allow file object creation in content processes

Changed
	- Log all used application arguments and not only -marionette

	- Early abort connection attempts to Marionette if the Firefox process closed unexpectedly

	- Removed deprecated socksProxyVersion in favor of socksVersion

	- Removed ftpProxyPort, httpProxyPort, sslProxyPort, and socksProxyPort because ports have to be set for ftpProxy, httpProxy, sslProxy, and socksProxy using ":"

	- The proxyType noproxy has been replaced with direct in accordance with recent WebDriver specification changes

	- The WindowRectParameters have been updated to return signed 32-bit integers in accordance with the CSS and WebDriver specifications, and to be more liberal with the input types

	- Mapped the FullscreenWindow to the correct Marionette command

	- To make sure no browser process is left behind when the NewSession fails, the process is closed immediately now

	- /moz/addon/install command accepts an addon parameter, in lieu of path, containing an addon as a Base64 string (fixed by Jason Juang)

	- webdriver crate upgraded to version 0.31.0

	- mozrunner crate upgraded to version 0.5.0

Removed
	- Removed the following obsolete preferences for Firefox:
		- browser.safebrowsing.enabled
		- browser.safebrowsing.forbiddenURIs.enabled
		- marionette.defaultPrefs.port
		- marionette.logging
